# AirMind AI — System Architecture Specification

> Technical architecture document for AirMind AI: AI-Powered Urban Air Quality Intelligence Platform. Developed for the ET AI Hackathon 2026.

---

## 1. System Overview

### Problem Statement
Rapid urbanization and industrial growth have escalated ambient air pollution in major smart cities. Traditional monitoring infrastructure remains **reactive**—it displays historical or current pollution levels after exposure occurs but provides minimal support for proactive decision-making. Furthermore, citizens and city planners lack high-resolution predictive forecasts and tailored public health advisories.

### Purpose of AirMind AI
**AirMind AI** is designed as a proactive, AI-driven Urban Air Quality Intelligence platform. It bridges the gap between raw environmental monitoring and actionable decision-making by:
- Ingesting live pollutant concentrations (`PM2.5`, `PM10`, `NO2`, `SO2`, `CO`, `O3`) and meteorological metrics.
- Serving machine learning-based current AQI estimates and multi-horizon forecasts (24-hour and 72-hour trends).
- Visualizing localized pollution hotspots on interactive Leaflet maps and Recharts trendlines.
- Auto-generating targeted public health advisories for general citizens and vulnerable demographics.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The platform follows a decoupled, service-oriented modular architecture separating data ingestion, machine learning inference, API delivery, and client-side rendering.

## 4. Data Flow Architecture

The end-to-end data lifecycle moves through seven distinct stages:

```text
1. Data Collection ──► 2. Cleaning ──► 3. Feature Extraction ──► 4. ML Inference ──► 5. API Response ──► 6. Frontend Render ──► 7. User Action
```

1. **AQI & Weather Data Collection**: FastAPI integration client fetches live air pollutant readings and meteorological attributes from OpenWeather APIs for a user-selected city or coordinate set.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Raw JSON responses are validated via Pydantic schemas, replacing missing or zero values with domain fallback defaults.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Features (`PM2.5`, `PM10`, `NO2`, `SO2`, `CO`, `O3`, temperature, humidity) are extracted and arranged into numpy feature arrays.
4. **ML Model Prediction**: The backend predictor deserializes pre-trained Scikit-learn estimators to compute current AQI and 24h/72h forecast values.
5. **Backend API Response Generation**: The service layer bundles current AQI, forecasts, pollutant breakdowns, and health recommendation strings into a unified JSON API payload.
6. **Frontend Visualization**: The React client receives the payload via Axios, updates `CityContext`, and re-renders the dashboard widgets, Recharts line graphs, and Leaflet map markers.
7. **User Insights & Alerts**: End users view real-time AQI levels, forecast trends, and targeted health advisories (e.g., outdoor activity restrictions).
